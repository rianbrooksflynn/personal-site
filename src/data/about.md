# Intro

I am a 2024–2025 [A3D3](https://a3d3.ai/) Postbaccalaureate Fellow, working with [Prof. Miaoyuan Liu](https://mia.physics.purdue.edu/) at Purdue. We are using [hls4ml](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml) to implement efficient transformers on FPGAs, for applications in the Level-1 Trigger of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider operated by [CERN](https://home.cern/).

I am applying to Ph.D. programs in information science and computer science for fall 2025 entry. I am broadly interested in enabling equitable, ethical, and inclusive societal futures through researching artificial intelligence in a sociotechnical framework, and specifically passionate about fostering connection, collaboration, and constructiveness in online communities using natural language processing (NLP) technologies.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Seeq](https://www.seeq.com/), which makes data analytics software for process manufacturing companies. I received my Bachelor of Science in physics and theater arts from MIT.
